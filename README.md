# What it does
* Checks which is the next episode you haven't seen yet.
* Creates links to Uloz.to that are searches for specific episodes.
* It generates only links for published episodes or stops at 20.
* If you need more than 20 links, you have a problem. (Which you can solve by searching for number 20 in code.)

# Installation
* It's small script running in your browser.
* You need something like Greasemonkey for FireFox ("Allows you to customize the way a web page displays or behaves, by using small bits of JavaScript.") to run the script. https://addons.mozilla.org/cs/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/
* There is Chrome alternative, Tampermonkey: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo
* After installing the browser extension, install the script: http://wiki.greasespot.net/Greasemonkey_Manual:Installing_Scripts / http://tampermonkey.net/faq.php?ext=dhdg#Q102
* The script you need is here: https://github.com/radimklaska/followmy.tv-uloz.to/raw/master/followmy.tv-uloz.to.user.js Just visit the URL and Tamper/Grease monkeay should catch it. Or do whatever their manual says. :)
